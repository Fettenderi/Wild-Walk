# Wilk Walk

is a VR university project made in Unity by the Bandersnatch Team.

The experience aims to be an accessible and fun way to let people with physical disabilities have a walk within Valle Cervo in Piedmont. It was built in Unity using the Spatial API to be uploaded into the Valle Cervo metaverse.

I was the Level Designer and Environment Artist of the team. My job was to search and create 3D assets to build a recreation of the Valle Cervo, with its diverse vegetation and beautiful town of Rosazza.
